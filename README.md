## How It Works

Purple Pickaxe monitors your active Twitch session and:

1. Detects when you are logged into Twitch.

3. Tracks active Twitch Drop campaigns.
4. Claims completed Drops automatically.
5. Stores settings and statistics locally on your device.

All processing occurs locally within the extension.
